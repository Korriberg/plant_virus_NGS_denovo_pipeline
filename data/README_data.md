# Data

The original FASTQ files used for this analysis come from a university course and cannot be redistributed here.

To reproduce the pipeline, you can substitute any paired-end plant virus NGS dataset from SRA.
Example datasets (paired-end):

- Arabidopsis + CMV infection (RNA-seq): SRR*******  
- General plant virus WGS/RNA-seq datasets: search terms "plant virus RNA-seq paired end".

Place downloaded FASTQ files in:
`data/raw/`
and update file names in the scripts accordingly.
